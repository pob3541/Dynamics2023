# Dataset for recreating figures from Boucher et al., 2023
---
Experimental data used to construct the figures found in (tested in Matlab R2021b):

> P. O. Boucher, T. Wang, L. Carceroni, G. Kane, K. V. Shenoy, C. Chandramouli.
> *** Initial conditions combine with sensory evidence to induce decision-related dynamics in premotor cortex ***


Experimental data ([doi:10.5061/dryad.9cnp5hqn0](doi:10.5061/dryad.9cnp5hqn0)) and scripts ([https://github.com/pob3541/Dynamics2023](https://github.com/pob3541/Dynamics2023)) are organized based on the order of figures in the manuscript.

Download Github repository:        `git clone https://github.com/pob3541/Dynamics2023.git`

Toolboxes needed: 
- Curve Fitting Toolbox
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
- Bioinformatics Toolbox

For the repository to work on your computer please add the Dynamics2023 folder with all subfolders to your MATLAB path (add utils separately).


## Description of the data and file structure

### Figure 2: Psychometric curves for the monkey, and RT and box plots

Open figure2.m. Run this script to load behavioral data for both monkeys. Script then displays psychometric curves (percent responded red as a function of signed coherence), reaction time (RT) curves as a function of signed coherence, and boxplots of RTs organized by stimulus coherence for both monkeys.

## Code/Software

This is an optional, freeform section for describing any code in your submission and the software used to run it.

Describe any scripts, code, or notebooks (e.g., R, Python, Mathematica, MatLab) as well as the software versions (including loaded packages) that you used to run those files. If your repository contains more than one file whose relationship to other scripts is not obvious, provide information about the workflow that you used to run those scripts and notebooks.
